//! Overlay window lifecycle: sizing it over the whole virtual desktop,
//! showing, hiding, and keeping it fitted while the display configuration
//! changes underneath it.
//!
//! The window itself is declared in `tauri.conf.json` and created hidden at
//! startup — showing it is then a reposition + `show()`, cheap enough for the
//! < 100 ms hotkey-to-visible budget (quality-bars.md §1). Creating the window
//! on demand would not be.
//!
//! Geometry decisions live in `uptake_core::geometry`; this module only maps
//! Tauri's monitor reports into core types and talks to the OS.
